//Jodianne Bartolo Final Game: Lactose Foe
//My game is a coninuous runner style game where the player's goal is to get home 
//by defeating a certain amount of zombies before losing lives. Level 1 is the hadest because the zombies come at you pretty fast.
// You can shoot ice cream balls at them by pressing b. If you are close to them you can press a to head butt them.
//Shooting them with an ice ball gets you 1 pt in your ice cream meter, but head butting them gets you 2 points.
//Once you fill it up with 10 zombies, you go to the in between level. Here you have to catch 20 ice cream balls to proceed.
//You have 6 lives and if you lose them all, you have to start the game over.
//If you get all 20, you go to the next level. The car is now faster, but the zombies come slower.
//Fill up the meter to 10 again and then drive home.

//cheats--> press L to jump in car and kill zombies
// press a on catch level to refill lives
